# Incident-Report-Analysis-DDoS-Attack-Mitigation

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a DDoS attack incident at a multimedia company, applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to identify and address the security vulnerabilities, and developing a comprehensive plan to improve the company's network security. The incident was resolved by implementing new security measures to prevent future attacks.

## Project Scope and Goals

Scope: 
The project focuses on the identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery aspects of the NIST CSF in relation to the DDoS attack.

Goals:
- Analyze the DDoS attack and identify the security vulnerabilities exploited.
- Develop and implement measures to protect against similar future attacks.
- Improve detection capabilities to identify potential threats early.
- Establish a response plan to effectively address future incidents.
- Enhance recovery procedures to minimize downtime and data loss.

## Skills Learned

- Incident Response: Gained experience in managing and mitigating DDoS attacks.
- Network Security: Enhanced understanding of firewall configurations and network traffic monitoring.
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Applied the NIST CSF to a real-world scenario, improving security planning and strategy.
- Communication: Improved ability to communicate security incidents and recovery plans to stakeholders.
- Continuous Improvement: Learned the importance of regular security audits and updates to maintain a robust security posture.

## Tools Used

- Google Docs for reording my findings and doumenting the Incident Report Analysis.

## Steps

1. Summary:
- Documented the DDoS attack and its impact on network services.
- Identified the unconfigured firewall as the vulnerability exploited.

2. Identify:
- Conducted an audit of systems, devices, and access policies.
- Traced the flow of the attack and identified affected business processes and personnel.

3. Protect:
- Implemented firewall rules to limit ICMP packet rates and verify source IP addresses.
- Provided employee training on security best practices.
- Updated firewall configurations and implemented an IPS.

4. Detect:
- Utilized firewall logging tools and IDS to monitor incoming traffic.
- Enhanced detection processes to identify and alert on anomalies.

5. Respond:
- Disabled compromised accounts and communicated response procedures.
- Analyzed the attack to refine response strategies.
- Implemented measures to mitigate the impact and isolate affected resources.

6. Recover:
- Restored network services and reconfigured security measures.
- Improved recovery processes to ensure swift restoration in future incidents.
- Communicated restoration procedures to stakeholders.
